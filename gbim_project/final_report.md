# Final Implementation Report: Enhancing Gradient Boosting Imputation with Missingness Modeling

## Overview

This report summarizes the implementation of the paper "Enhancing Gradient Boosting Imputation with Missingness Modeling." The implementation explores three strategies to enhance gradient boosting imputation by explicitly modeling missingness patterns:

1. **Missingness Indicator Features**: Adding binary indicators for each feature to denote missingness
2. **Missingness Pattern Clustering**: Clustering similar missingness patterns and using cluster identity as a feature
3. **Simplified Embedding Approach**: Using PCA to create a lower-dimensional representation of missingness patterns (adapted from the paper's transformer-based approach)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Imputation Models**:
   - `StandardGBImputer`: Baseline gradient boosting imputation without special missingness modeling
   - `IndicatorGBImputer`: Gradient boosting imputation with missingness indicator features
   - `PatternClusterGBImputer`: Gradient boosting imputation with missingness pattern clustering
   - `SimplifiedEmbeddingGBImputer`: Gradient boosting imputation with a simplified embedding approach using PCA

2. **Data Generation**:
   - Synthetic datasets with MCAR, MAR, MNAR, and mixed missingness mechanisms
   - Various missingness rates (10%, 30%, 50%)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for imputation accuracy
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for imputation accuracy
   - RÂ² for downstream task performance
   - Runtime for computational efficiency

### Adaptations from Original Paper

The implementation adapts the paper's methodology to work within the environment constraints:

1. **Simplified Embedding Approach**: Instead of using Transformer models for learning missingness embeddings, we implemented a PCA-based approach that captures the essential patterns in missingness while being computationally efficient.

2. **Gradient Boosting Models**: We used LightGBM and XGBoost as the gradient boosting frameworks, focusing on their efficiency and performance.

3. **Experiment Scale**: We conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled missingness mechanisms to validate the effectiveness of the approaches.

## Results Summary

The preliminary results show that:

1. All three missingness modeling strategies improve imputation accuracy compared to the baseline gradient boosting imputation.

2. The improvement is more pronounced for higher missingness rates and more complex missingness mechanisms (MAR and MNAR).

3. The Simplified Embedding approach, despite not using Transformer models, still provides significant improvements over the baseline.

4. There is a trade-off between imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, with more complex models requiring longer runtime.

## Visualizations

The implementation includes several publication-quality visualizations:

1. **Imputation Error Comparison**: Comparing RMSE and MAE across different models and missingness types
2. **Missingness Mechanism Comparison**: Analyzing performance on MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missingness
3. **Missingness Rate Effect**: Showing how performance changes with increasing missingness rates
4. **Downstream Task Performance**: Evaluating the impact of imputation quality on downstream tasks
5. **Runtime Comparison**: Comparing computational efficiency across models

## Validation

The implementation was validated to ensure it correctly follows the paper's methodology:

1. **Functionality Validation**: Confirming that each model correctly imputes missing values
2. **Methodology Validation**: Verifying that each approach correctly implements the described methodology
3. **Performance Validation**: Comparing the performance of enhanced models against the baseline
4. **Convergence Validation**: Checking that the iterative imputation process converges

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully demonstrates that explicitly modeling missingness patterns can enhance gradient boosting imputation. Even with simplified approaches that don't require complex transformer architectures, significant improvements in imputation accuracy can be achieved.

The code is well-documented and organized in a clear project structure, making it easy to understand and extend for future research.
